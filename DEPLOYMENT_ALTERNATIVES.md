# Alternative Deployment Options for RAG QA Foundation

Due to Vercel's limitations with Docker deployment and large ML dependencies, here are alternative deployment strategies:

## Option 1: Railway (Recommended for Docker)
Railway supports Docker containers natively and doesn't have the 250MB limit.

```bash
# Install Railway CLI
npm install -g @railway/cli

# Login and deploy
railway login
railway deploy
```

Create `railway.json`:
```json
{
  "deploy": {
    "dockerfile": "Dockerfile.vercel"
  }
}
```

## Option 2: Google Cloud Run
Excellent for containerized FastAPI applications with ML dependencies.

```bash
# Build and push to Google Container Registry
gcloud builds submit --tag gcr.io/[PROJECT-ID]/rag-qa-app

# Deploy to Cloud Run
gcloud run deploy --image gcr.io/[PROJECT-ID]/rag-qa-app --platform managed
```

## Option 3: AWS App Runner
Simple container deployment on AWS.

```bash
# Build and push to ECR
aws ecr create-repository --repository-name rag-qa-app
docker build -f Dockerfile.vercel -t rag-qa-app .
docker tag rag-qa-app:latest [ACCOUNT].dkr.ecr.[REGION].amazonaws.com/rag-qa-app:latest
docker push [ACCOUNT].dkr.ecr.[REGION].amazonaws.com/rag-qa-app:latest
```

## Option 4: Render
Simple Docker deployment with free tier.

```bash
# Connect your GitHub repo to Render
# Select "Web Service" -> "Docker" 
# Use Dockerfile.vercel
```

## Option 5: Vercel Serverless (Limited)
For smaller applications without heavy ML dependencies.

Requirements for Vercel serverless:
- Function size < 50MB
- Memory < 1GB
- No persistent storage

If you still want to try Vercel serverless:
1. Use the `api/index.py` handler I created
2. Move vector store to external storage (S3, etc.)
3. Use lighter ML libraries

## Recommended: Railway Deployment

Railway is the best alternative to Vercel for your use case:
- Native Docker support
- No arbitrary size limits
- Simple deployment process
- Good free tier

### Quick Railway Setup:

1. Install Railway CLI:
```bash
npm install -g @railway/cli
```

2. Login and initialize:
```bash
railway login
railway init
```

3. Deploy:
```bash
railway up
```

Railway will automatically detect your Dockerfile and deploy it.
